# Daily Planner
## Work Day Scheduler 
### Description

I was tasked by the client to produce a work day scheduler

It had to include the following:

- The date at the top of the page, that updated dynamically
- A color scheme to differentiate between past times, present and future 
- The functionality to write into the text areas
- A button to save events to local storage

A lot of the elements in this job were similiar to previous ones. Instead of using pure JavaScript, I used jQuery. I achieved more on less lines of code, but still feel I'll be using vanilla JavaScript more going forward.



## Challenges Faced

### MomentJS

At first I thought it was quite a simple challenge. The HTML and CSS were already setup for us. However, some of the momentjs intergration proved a bit more difficult. If one of the assignment goals was to make sure you read the API documentation, it certainly did it's job.

### For Next Time
Had to do a lot of revision for this assignment. I want to re-write this in pure JavaScript, just to make sure I understand the JavaScript rather than just the jQuery.
Also, I would add a clear function to clear the events in the textAreas.
